# Sinatra API Skeleton

This is a very simple file tree to be used as a boilerplate when building Sinatra APIs.

# When you're local:

## Start server
Go to home directory and run `shotgun`. If this doesnt work run `gem install shotgun` then try again

## Access console
Go to home directory and run `irb -r './app'`

## Run tests
Go to home directory and run `rspec spec`. Dont forget to stub your code!
